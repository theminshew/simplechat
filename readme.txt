This is my attempts to take lesson 12 from Learn python the hard way to a different level.
I'm really just trying to learn and don't have a real objective, learning git, github as well as c and sql on the side so don't know how often i'll mess with this.

Fyi I am testing and running the program through powershell
you can copy and do whatever you want with this as its terrible code right now :)
